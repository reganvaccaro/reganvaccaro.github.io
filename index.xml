      <description>Nebraska won 3 games this year. They should have won more.
Even with such a disappointing record, the 2021 Nebraska football team competed shockingly well against their opponents. They are even being debated as one of the best 3-9 college football teams to ever play the game. Each game ended with a single digit point differential and the season’s record could have been drastically different with a difference of outcome for even a few plays.</description>

      <description>Dániel Sallói and Carles Gil are two players that have undoubtedly made a sizable impact on their programs since their start. With Sallói coming into Sporting Kansas City at just 20 years old in 2016, and Gil arriving at the New England Revolution in 2019, both have made their way to the leader boards. Playing at a striker position for much of his career with KC, Sallói has scored a total of 34 goals with the team with 16 of those being game-winning goals.</description>
